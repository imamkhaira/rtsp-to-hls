QMS installed at IWK Counters

Several issues need to resolve:
1. Report not tallied and  inaccurate.
 - Status: in progress
 - Note: finding alternative way to record queue data every hour, and periodically send to server.
   this proves to be very difficult due to the limitation of SQL Server 2008, used in QMS machine.
   
2. QMS machine dispensing automatically without being pressed.
  - Status: pending test
  - Note: Testing a new script that will disable and re-enable touchscreen driver instead of restarting the whole qms machine

3. Report is still being done manually and can't be extracted from CMS.
  - Status: pending issue no 1
  - Note: There my be changes required to the reporting API due to changes in the tally system.
    we'll work on this when issue no 1 has been fixed

4. QMS machine broken and require long time to repair. In the meantime data not available at UO
  - Status: installing at Klang site
  - Note: will install this replacement hardware

5. Developing new QMS Software
  - Status: fixing issue
  - Note: cannot use printer and callpad yet (because no driver is available, need more research)
